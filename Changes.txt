== Version 0.6.7

* put install-stamp files into logdir, to clean up the installation prefix
* added Autobuild.post_install: run an external program or call a block after
  all packages have been successfully built

== Version 0.6.6

* add Package#post_install: executes either a block or an external
  command after the package has been installed
* allow to reference pkg-config packages not built by autobuild.
  The .pc file is then used as installation stamp file
* the configure.ac.user file generated by Genom may not be present
  in the RCS. Do not expect it to be there after import.
* removed the Ruby package. If there are extensions to build, better
  have a post_install script to do that

== Version 0.6.5

* add Autobuild.default_packages
* big rdoc update

== Version 0.6.4

This is a bugfix release

* More checks for working copy sanity: check that the target working copy
  has been created by the right tools before doing anything. Update test
  suite so that these parts of the importers is tested
* Since we grep 'svn info' output, make sure that its output will be in 
  english by setting LC_ALL to C

== Version 0.6.3

* CVS and SVN importing plugins check that the current working copy comes from
  the right source
* the autotools and genom package are now reconfiguring if the flags
  (configureflags and/or genomflags) changed
* bugfixes

== Version 0.6.2

Small changes

* added the Ruby package, which does an import and builds all C extensions
* added the pkgconfig package, which allows to use an already-installed package
  if this packages can be found through pkg-config
* check that working copies that are already checked out are from the right
  source (for CVS and Subversion)

== Version 0.6.1

Bugfixes

* fix dependency handling for Genom modules. In particular, we add 
  dependencies between the module generation and the installed
  genom files (includes, canvas, and the genom executable). Information
  is taken from the pkg-config file
* new package types: InstalledPkgConfig, to reuse pkg-config based packages
  installed by another autobuild script

== Version 0.6

Use a Ruby-based DSL instead of YAML config files. It is waaaaaay more
powerful and waaay cleaner. See demo.rb for an example

* Added the Darcs importer
* Fixes in dependency handling
* Uses Rake 0.7

== Version 0.5.1

Fixes the release process, in which the bin/ directory was not distributed

* 0.5 gem did not include bin/autobuild (which obviously was not good). Fix that

== Version 0.5

Fixes the mail default behaviour. Added the 'tar' importer.

* all the API is now in a separate module
* genflags has been renamed back to genomflags. The convention is now to
  have a <tool>flags option. For instance: genomflags, configureflags
* added the --[no-]build option to do only import
* changed behaviour for mail reports:
    - set sensible default options for mail
    - mail: true uses default options
    - mail: <string> is equivalent to
        mail:
            to: <string>
* if a value is undefined in the config file, parameter expansion tries to get
  it from the program environment, and raises an error if it is not present in
  the environment vars
* changed the names of log files. All importers now uses <package>-<import>.log
* added the 'tar' importer, which downloads and uncompress a tarball 


== Version 0.4

* added support to split import and build. For instance

    whole_tree:
        type: import
        import: cvs
        source: [ a, repository ]

    package1:
        type: autotools
        srcdir: whole_tree/package1
        depends: whole_tree
        
    package2:
        type: autotools
        srcdir: whole_tree/package2
        depends: whole_tree
        
  Works as it should

* the <tt>autotools</tt> package has now an <tt>autogen</tt> options, which gives a name for a script
  which creates the autotools environment
* renamed 'genomflags' -> 'genflags'
* variable interpolation checks for environment variables
* bugfixes

== Version 0.3

* added support for patching source code. Add patch: [ patches ] to the package configuration
* renamed autobuild-config, common-config and clean-log to autobuild, common and clean_log. Autobuild
  warns if it finds one the previous spelling but ignores it anyway
