== Version 1.5.36
* fix wrong caching behaviour in the orogen handler, which was leading to having
  failures in the orogen package handler

== Version 1.5.35
* fix some bad behaviour when using fallback importers
  - git does not update the git configuration with the bad URLs anymore
* orogen: removed automatic dependency detection, it was half-broken anyway.
* orogen: avoid unnecessary regeneration (experimental, disabled by default).
  It can be enabled by setting Autobuild::Orogen.always_regenerate = true

== Version 1.5.34
* make sure oroGen handlers will trigger a new generation
  on force-build

== Version 1.5.33
* fix autobuild failing if the generated documentation
  is not in the doc_dir, as expected. It now reports
  a warning, as it should

== Version 1.5.32
* autobuild importers delete the source directory when
  initial checkouts fail. They now display a message
  when they do so to avoid user confusion
* the Autobuild::Orogen.transports array can be used to
  configure which transports are generated in orogen
  packages

== Version 1.5.31
* allow to override the type export policy for oroGen
  >= 1.1
* allow to provide CMAKE_MODULE_PATH in the cmake
  handler. Unfortunately, cmake does not support
  setting this through environment variables, so we
  have to pass it as -D
* make ignore_errors work for updates as well. We
  obviously still have to fail on checkout

== Version 1.5.30
* make the autotools handler behave more normally,
  calling "configure" without --no-create and not
  calling config.status before make by default. The old
  behaviour can be restored by setting
  #force_config_status to true on the package.

== Version 1.5.29
* added --version

== Version 1.5.28
* fix failure when all packages are built in a different prefix than
  Autobuild.prefix. The main log directory was not created, which was leading
  to a failure to create stats.log

== Version 1.5.27
* small fixes

== Version 1.5.26
* add statistics support

== Version 1.5.25
* small bugfixes

== Version 1.5.24
* fix bug with git importer and the push_to option. The pushurl configuration
  option was not set in just-cloned repositories
* improve error message in the "merge" case of git updates
* fix appearance of a backtrace when CTRL+C was hit just at the same time that
  we start a subcommand

== Version 1.5.23
* fix bug with paths that contain regexp special characters like C++

== Version 1.5.22
* minor change to #env_add_path. The provided directory is not filtered out
  anymore if it does not exist, to avoid the API user to *have* to call it
  *after* the packages have been installed

== Version 1.5.21
* add an argument to status() to avoid using the network (for importers that can
  do that, i.e. git)
* disable changing the subprocess priorities by default. This is so that people
  can use 'nice' on the autobuild script if they don't know that autobuild
  supports changing the priority itself.
* add the Autobuild.ignore_errors option. If set, the build will go on even if
  some errors occur. Errors are properly reported at the end of the build.
* git: update branch tracking information to track the specified branch
* git: offer the push_to option as a way to specify a push URL, in cases
  where having separate read-only and read-write URLs makes sense.

== Version 1.5.20
* cmake: inform the user if a CMake configuration value gets changed

== Version 1.5.19
* git: fix cases where the importer was assuming that a branch did not exist
  while it was
* orogen: import_types_from accepts arguments for loading files. Be compatible
  with that.

== Version 1.5.18
* minor addition to the API for autoproj

== Version 1.5.17
* add a way to specify global ignores for listing files in source directories

== Version 1.5.16
* update the TYPELIB_RUBY_PLUGIN_PATH and OROCOS_ROBY_PLUGIN_PATH environment
  variables, as oroGen now installs plugin files from the oroGen project into
  these directories

== Version 1.5.15
* display a message when git switches branches

== Version 1.5.14
* fix Ruby 1.9 rejecting some git logs if they have a weird encoding

== Version 1.5.13
* fix error messages in the oroGen packages, when the loaded oroGen file has an
  error

== Version 1.5.12
* fix exception when git logs contain non-ASCII characters on Ruby 1.9 version
  compiled with another default encoding than UTF-8 (!)

== Version 1.5.11
* don't sleep unnecessarily on filesystems that have sub-second modification
  time resolutions. This speeds up builds.

== Version 1.5.10
* avoid unnecessary reconfigurations in the autotools handler

== Version 1.5.9
* small fixes
* fixed some corner-case problems with log files not being created in the right
  folders

== Version 1.5.8
* fix major issue while setting up dependencies
* small 1.8/1.9 compatibility fix in Autotools#use
* small backward compatibility fix w.r.t. Configurable.builddir

== Version 1.5.7
* the "importer" package will now rebuild if the main prefix is deleted. It was
  previously not, which was leading to partial builds if the actual installation
  was done by a post_install block
* fix the documentation mode

== Version 1.5.6
* fix the directory in error message when a git importer detects a non-git
  repository

== Version 1.5.5
* small API additions

== Version 1.5.4
* support orogen's --extended-states
* small API fix when subclassing CMake package handler

== Version 1.5.3
* quickfix for RUBYLIB on OSes that install libraries in usr/lib32 or usr/lib64
  instead of usr/lib

== Version 1.5.2
* fix broken mail reporting. The mail report was always saved in a file since
  1.5.1.
* fix small bugs in the patching part of the import
  - be error tolerant: if patching/unpatching fails, we go back to a well
    defined state instead of having to fix the package by hand
  - do not apply patches unnecessarily

== Version 1.5.1
* autotools: must run libtool before the other tools
* autotools: properly autodetect need for autoconf (autoconf was always enabled
  before)
* logs: properly log everything that happens in one session. The previous
  behaviour was to have, in each log file, only the last command that has been
  run.
* logs: only attach relevant logs to report mails. The previous behaviour was to
  attach all log files that were in <prefix>/log

== Version 1.5.0
* now Ruby1.9 compatibility fixes, can be run with ruby1.9.1 on Debian
* properly runs if the ruby interpreter is not called 'ruby', as ruby1.9.1
  on Debian
* fix some issues with the usage of #depends_on *before* Package#srcdir #logdir
  and #prefix were set. It fixes an autoproj bug in case the autobuild files use
  #depends_on
* the archive importer now properly handles interruptions
* the archive importer now properly autodetects file names if the URLs contains '?'
* fixed the importer package type
* fixed some rare issues with internal dependency definitions. This bug was
  usually manifesting itself with rake exceptions whose message were "do not
  know how to build <package name>-stamp"

== Version 1.4.9
* quickfix an issue related to a discrepancy between the definition of the
  installstamp and the definition of the log dir.

== Version 1.4.8
* make the archive importer nicer to use:
  - the archive_dir is unneeded for tarballs from now on
  - filename detection works better (and therefore the :filename option will be
    less needed)

== Version 1.4.7
* have the git importer update the autobuild remote on update.

== Version 1.4.6
* add missing importer/archive.rb file

== Version 1.4.5
* add support for zip in TarImporter, which is renamed ArchiveImporter to
  reflect that. Backward compatibility is retained.
* support sourceforge-like setups in ArchiveImporter: use wget for download and
  add a :filename option to specify what is the name of the downloaded file.
* improve configurability of the progress display for tools built on top of
  autobuild
* always call with_doc in orogen packages, as orogen itself adds a documentation
  target

== Version 1.4.4
* minor bug fixes

== Version 1.4.3
* minor changes in how the shell environment is managed
* update LD_LIBRARY_PATH when applicable
* fix parsing of genom 'require' statements (fix from Matthieu Gallien)
* fix issues with tracking tags and commits (fix from Matthieu Gallien)

== Version 1.4.2
* call subversion with the --non-interactive option, otherwise the build will
  block indefinitely. Note that git "questions" are properly passed to the user.
* don't forcefully depend on orogen being available. This fixes bootstrapping
  situations where both orogen and some orogen modules need to be built.
* workaround CMake heavy-caching behaviour. When a reconfiguration is needed,
  delete the CMakeCache.txt file instead of recalling cmake on top of it. It
  should fix most of the problems of CMake related to caching of pkg-config
  files for instance.

== Version 1.4.0
* cmake package handler now displays progress value
* added support for parallel builds
* added the long-awaited --force-build and --rebuild options.
  The first one forces the call to all the build steps, but without deleting the
  build products. The second one deletes all build products and retriggers a
  full build.

== Version 1.3.3
* fix: changing Orogen.corba now affects packages that have already been
  declared but for which the #corba attribute has not been set explicitely to
  true or false.
* fix issues with the parsing of codel requirement in the genom package handler

== Version 1.3.2
* fix stupid issues with the genom package
* import caller's environment instead of erasing it.

== Version 1.3.1
* 1.3.* now depend on utilrb, add it to the gem dependency list

== Version 1.3.0
* major update of the user interaction. Autobuild is now much less verbose, and
  (hopefully) displays more useful error messages in most cases.
* make the library easier to use to build other tools (i.e. not so much
  autobuild-centered anymore)
* add the :branch and :tag targets to the git importer. The git importer should
  now be used as:
    Autobuild.git(URL, :branch => branch_name)
  OR
    Autobuild.git(URL, :tag => tag_name_or_commit_id)
  
  This puts it in line with the other importers which have a
  Autobuild.importer_type(URL, option_hash) form.

== Version 1.2.15
* fix branch switching in the git importer: the build will not fail anymore if
  autobuild has to switch to an already existing branch

== Version 1.2.14
* fix git importer's handling of branch names: the importer now always works on
  a local branch that has the same name than the remote branch.

== Version 1.2.12
* reconfigure orogen packages if orogen itself has been updated

== Version 1.2.11
* fix small issues with CMake
  - CMake 2.6 can convert option values between what the user provides (for
    instance YES) and what is written in the cache (ON). Take that into account
  - if the first configuration fails, no Makefile is generated but
    a CMakeCache.txt is there. Autobuild was failing in that situation and will
    now handle it gracefully.

== Version 1.2.10
* small fix
  logs are sorted into subdirectories, following the structure of the
  packages. Up until now, the mailing code was not searching for logfiles in the
  subdirectories. This commit fixes this.

== Version 1.2.9
* small usability issue
  - provide the --keep-oldlogs command line option and the
    Autobuild.erase_oldlogs configuration flag to configure whether old logs
    should be kept (new data being appended to them), or erased
  - change the default behaviour from keeping old logs to erasing them

== Version 1.2.8
* small fix
  - fixes --mail-smtp. This now works even without port specification.

== Version 1.2.7
* fixes to documentation support
  - '--no-doc' now works
  - failures to generate documentation are now simple warnings, an error can be obtained
    by setting Autobuild.doc_errors or by using the --doc-errors command line flag

== Version 1.2.6
* really fix the dependency problem
* add documentation support in autotools

== Version 1.2.5
* really fix the git fetch phase
* fix a dependency issue between code generation and CMake configuration
  in the orogen package type

== Version 1.2.4
* git update phase now fetches the repository and branch specified by the
  autobuild script. It previously was using remote tracking branches. This
  will allow to detect branch changes in the autobuild specification.
* documentation support. Packages can now declare that they can generate
  documentation (see Package#doc_task and CMake#with_doc). That documentation
  is generated post-build and installed.
* fix build updates in the CMake package class.

== Version 1.2.3
* Fix git update again. FETCH_HEAD may resolve as an ID which is not the one
  to be selected for merge
* Make the dependency on RMail optional
* added the orogen package type

== Version 1.2
* Fix git update
* Fix cmake dependency handling. Give a way to always run cmake before running
  make (needed sometime)
* Fix the genom package handling

== Version 1.1
* Make the CVS importer discard differences on method and username between the
  current root and the configured root
* Allow to specify exclusions in the importer package, which are used to
  ignore some changes in the source tree. Useful if some packages are built
  inside the imported source tree
* added the git importer
* added the cmake package
* set the current repository as default global prefix and srcdir
* misc fixes w.r.t. handling dependencies
* added Autobuild.post_success_message

== Version 1.0.1
* The "test suites are there for something" release
* Fixes bugs introduced in the last version
* Added a real example in samples/openrobots.rb
* Fixed documentation in various places
* Fail more gracefully on circular dependencies

== Version 1.0

* Releasing 1.0. Autobuild is stable, and is in daily use at my work
* Handle .tgz as valid tar extension (Closes #11722)
* Fix bug in the tar importer, which made checkout fail (Closes #11716)

== Version 0.6.7

* put install-stamp files into logdir, to clean up the installation prefix
* added Autobuild.post_install: run an external program or call a block after
  all packages have been successfully built
* bugfix: darcs get expects that the path to the destination directory already
  exists. Create it ourselves if it does not exist.
* bugfix: when computing the timestamp of a source tree, exclude .svn and _darcs
  directories
* bugfix: 'opencv.pc' were searched in PkgConfig packages instead of the
  actual .pc file ...
* bugfix: installed_pkgconfig is supposed to be a singleton method of Autobuild
* bugfix: "darcs get" expects that the path leading to the destination
  directory exists. Create it.
* bugfix: fix handling of Genom's requires lists: we were previously expecting
  packages to be exactly separated by ', '

== Version 0.6.6

* add Package#post_install: executes either a block or an external
  command after the package has been installed
* allow to reference pkg-config packages not built by autobuild.
  The .pc file is then used as installation stamp file
* the configure.ac.user file generated by Genom may not be present
  in the RCS. Do not expect it to be there after import.
* removed the Ruby package. If there are extensions to build, better
  have a post_install script to do that

== Version 0.6.5

* add Autobuild.default_packages
* big rdoc update

== Version 0.6.4

This is a bugfix release

* More checks for working copy sanity: check that the target working copy
  has been created by the right tools before doing anything. Update test
  suite so that these parts of the importers is tested
* Since we grep 'svn info' output, make sure that its output will be in 
  english by setting LC_ALL to C

== Version 0.6.3

* CVS and SVN importing plugins check that the current working copy comes from
  the right source
* the autotools and genom package are now reconfiguring if the flags
  (configureflags and/or genomflags) changed
* bugfixes

== Version 0.6.2

Small changes

* added the Ruby package, which does an import and builds all C extensions
* added the pkgconfig package, which allows to use an already-installed package
  if this packages can be found through pkg-config
* check that working copies that are already checked out are from the right
  source (for CVS and Subversion)

== Version 0.6.1

Bugfixes

* fix dependency handling for Genom modules. In particular, we add 
  dependencies between the module generation and the installed
  genom files (includes, canvas, and the genom executable). Information
  is taken from the pkg-config file
* new package types: InstalledPkgConfig, to reuse pkg-config based packages
  installed by another autobuild script

== Version 0.6

Use a Ruby-based DSL instead of YAML config files. It is waaaaaay more
powerful and waaay cleaner. See demo.rb for an example

* Added the Darcs importer
* Fixes in dependency handling
* Uses Rake 0.7

== Version 0.5.1

Fixes the release process, in which the bin/ directory was not distributed

* 0.5 gem did not include bin/autobuild (which obviously was not good). Fix that

== Version 0.5

Fixes the mail default behaviour. Added the 'tar' importer.

* all the API is now in a separate module
* genflags has been renamed back to genomflags. The convention is now to
  have a <tool>flags option. For instance: genomflags, configureflags
* added the --[no-]build option to do only import
* changed behaviour for mail reports:
    - set sensible default options for mail
    - mail: true uses default options
    - mail: <string> is equivalent to
        mail:
            to: <string>
* if a value is undefined in the config file, parameter expansion tries to get
  it from the program environment, and raises an error if it is not present in
  the environment vars
* changed the names of log files. All importers now uses <package>-<import>.log
* added the 'tar' importer, which downloads and uncompress a tarball 


== Version 0.4

* added support to split import and build. For instance

    whole_tree:
        type: import
        import: cvs
        source: [ a, repository ]

    package1:
        type: autotools
        srcdir: whole_tree/package1
        depends: whole_tree
        
    package2:
        type: autotools
        srcdir: whole_tree/package2
        depends: whole_tree
        
  Works as it should

* the <tt>autotools</tt> package has now an <tt>autogen</tt> options, which gives a name for a script
  which creates the autotools environment
* renamed 'genomflags' -> 'genflags'
* variable interpolation checks for environment variables
* bugfixes

== Version 0.3

* added support for patching source code. Add patch: [ patches ] to the package configuration
* renamed autobuild-config, common-config and clean-log to autobuild, common and clean_log. Autobuild
  warns if it finds one the previous spelling but ignores it anyway
