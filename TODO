TODO list for Autobuild
  * create HTML log pages
  * use Logger to be able to remove all non-error output
   add a disable_packages attribute to Autobuild to disable the build of specific
    packages. This would allow to use autobuild in scripts where the list of packages
    is asked to the user
  * add an --interactive option, which could ask to disable/enable packages before doing
    the build
