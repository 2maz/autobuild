= Autobuild changelog

== Version 0.5

Fixes the mail default behaviour. Added the 'tar' importer.

* all the API is now in a separate module
* genflags has been renamed back to genomflags. The convention is now to
  have a <tool>flags option. For instance: genomflags, configureflags
* added the --[no-]build option to do only import
* changed behaviour for mail reports:
    - set sensible default options for mail
    - mail: true uses default options
    - mail: <string> is equivalent to
        mail:
            to: <string>
* if a value is undefined in the config file, parameter expansion tries to get
  it from the program environment, and raises an error if it is not present in
  the environment vars
* changed the names of log files. All importers now uses <package>-<import>.log
* added the 'tar' importer, which downloads and uncompress a tarball 


== Version 0.4

* added support to split import and build. For instance

    whole_tree:
        type: import
        import: cvs
        source: [ a, repository ]

    package1:
        type: autotools
        srcdir: whole_tree/package1
        depends: whole_tree
        
    package2:
        type: autotools
        srcdir: whole_tree/package2
        depends: whole_tree
        
  Works as it should

* the <tt>autotools</tt> package has now an <tt>autogen</tt> options, which gives a name for a script
  which creates the autotools environment
* renamed 'genomflags' -> 'genflags'
* variable interpolation checks for environment variables
* bugfixes

== Version 0.3

* added support for patching source code. Add patch: [ patches ] to the package configuration
* renamed autobuild-config, common-config and clean-log to autobuild, common and clean_log. Autobuild
  warns if it finds one the previous spelling but ignores it anyway
